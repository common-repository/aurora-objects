== Description ==

This plugin automatically copies any media added through WordPress' media uploader to [Aurora Objects](https://www.pcextreme.nl/en/aurora/). It then automatically replaces the URL to each media file with their respective AuroraObjects URL. Image thumbnails are also copied to Aurora Objects and delivered through there.

Uploading files *directly* to your Aurora Objects account/bucket is not currently supported by this plugin. Also, if you're adding this plugin to a site that's been around for a while, your existing media files will not be copied or served from Aurora Objects. Only newly uploaded files will be copied and served from Aurora Objects.

You'll also find a new icon next to the "Add Media" button when editing a post. This allows you to easily browse and manage files in your Aurora Objects Bucket.

*This plugin is based on an existing plugin:
[Amazon Web Services for WordPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/amazon-web-services/).*
